Register yourself for an opportunity to play from your dream team.

## Prerequisites

* [Git](https://git-scm.com) (to clone the project on the local system, otherwise you can download the project directly.)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (to build and run web app through CLI.) [Guid for Maven installation](https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/)
* [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

## Set up  

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ParamjotSingh5/Football_Registration

# Go into the repository
$ cd Football_Registration\Register

# Clean and pack the app
$ mvn clean package

# Go to the build batch file
$ cd target\bin

# Run the web app
$ webapp.bat

```

* If everything goes well, URL localhost:8080/ will be occupied with a runing webapp.

## How it Works

### üöÄ Page Load

* We are üîó binding the `focusout`, `click`, `change` and `keypress` events to the `input`, [`checkbox`, `radio`], `select` and `input[inputmode="numeric"]` form fields respectively.
* Fetching the countries and their corresponding dial codes from static resource, add that data into the select lists.

### üì§ focusout from input

* Whenever we focusout of any input text field, a method named `isSanitizedValue(val)` will be called, checks if value does not have a character mentioned in this regex `[<>();{}=\\s]+`. In this case we are further filtering the form felids on the basis of the `inputMode` attribute. `inputMode == "text"` case will lead to calling of `isAlphabatesOnly()` method.
* On the basis of return bit we apply or remove validation css classes to feedback element.

### üëá keypress in input[inputmode="numeric"]

* Right now, user is not allowed type other then numeric characters for `inputmode="numeric"` input fields . We have mapped the `keypress` event with `numericAllowedOnly()` method.
* By calling `preventDefault()` method on event, we are manipulating the default behavior of the user-agent.

### üé∞ change on select

* Changing selected option from select list, checks its value if other then 0.
* Special case: checks whether if its name is `countryselect`, if ‚úîÔ∏è `true`, calls a method `fecthStatesSelectList(selectedOptionText)` to bind data with state list, and kind of same procedure is followed when state list is changed for city select list.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Super special case: While working with form, we may encounter a stage, where a country does not have states in it üòï (try **Anguilla**). In that situation, we by-pass state select list selection, and directly calls `fetchCitySelectListForStates(selectedOptionText)` to bind data to city select list üßê.

### üìå click on checkbox/ radio

* To make sure that at least one of checkbox/ radio is checked from a group, we make call to `isAtleastCheckInputChecked(selector)` method. On the basis of the returned bit, we add a class to on each element of the group.

### Validating form

* All of the above mentioned form fields are validated according to their characteristics and their validation responses are recorded into a global variable. This global variable will passed on to `RespondValdationFailure()` to represent validation failures on to their particular fields.
* Similar validation processes happens on backend for "New User" and "Update User" request. If there is a validation failure on backend, a JSON object is sent back as response which we can send to `RespondValdationFailure()` to raise validation errors.
* If there is no any validation failures within the form, submit/update button will be enabled for submitting the form.

## Backend

* We have user Maven as dependency manager and build Tool, JAVA , Embedded Apache Tomcat server.
* Project Division:
  * **/Domain**  contains the domain object repersenting the database tables. They also comprises the logic for database operations.
  * **/DTO** (Data transfer objects) holds the object responsible for mapping data received to or send by server.
  * **/launch** `Main` Class entry point to our web application.
  * **/servlet** holds endpoint handlers.
  * **/Utilities** holds classes for extra logic that application needs to work efficiently like `Extensions.java` contains a method `hasColumn()` as follows.
